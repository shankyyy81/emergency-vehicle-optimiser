# Smart Traffic Light Control System Backend

This backend simulates an intelligent, real-time traffic signal system for a city's network of roads and intersections. It uses advanced data structures and algorithms to manage traffic flow, prioritize lanes, detect emergency vehicles, and coordinate multiple intersections.

## Structure
- `models/`: Data models for intersections, roads, lanes, vehicles, and signal states.
- `modules/`: Core logic modules (to be implemented).
- `main.py`: Entry point for running the simulation.

## Features
- Graph-based city modeling
- Real-time lane traffic analysis
- Dynamic signal timing
- Emergency vehicle override
- Multi-intersection synchronization
- Signal state rollback
- Historical data logging

## Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- (Dependencies to be added in `requirements.txt`)
